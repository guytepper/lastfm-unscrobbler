# Last.FM Unscrobbler

Last.FM does not allow deleting multiple scrobbles - only one at a time. This extension adds the missing feature.

## Installation

The extension is available to install for [**Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastfm-unscrobbler/pjlmjmkpaklofeinjkhhdcggbgjhahek) and [**Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/last-fm-unscrobbler/).

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone the project to your own machine.
3. Add the extension to your browser while you're on developer mode. If you've never done that before, I recommend reading this [**Getting Started**](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) tutorial.
4. Commit changes to your own branch.
5. Push your work back up to your fork.
6. Submit a Pull request 🕺

**Tip:** It's recommended to use [`web-ext`](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) for development. After installing `web-ext` globally on your machine, you can run `npm run chrome` or `npm run firefox`, and have the extension auto reloaded while developing .
**Note:** Please make sure to format your code using [**Prettier**](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
